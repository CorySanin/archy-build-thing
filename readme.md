# Archery
## Build system for pacman

Quickly trigger build jobs on a remote system (perhaps one with more RAM?) for debugging packaging issues. Switch between Artix and Arch to compare builds. Enable testing or staging repos in a single click.

Consult [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) and [config.example.json](config/config.example.json) to get an understanding of how to deploy Archery.
